# Food-blogging-Platform
Full-Stack Web Application

This is Food blogging platform which offers a delightful culinary experience, where users can explore and share recipes with detailed cooking instructions, ingredient lists, chef information, and tantalizing food photos. To ensure security and personalization, the platform requires user registration and login.

I have used npm packages like Multer for image uploads, as well as Express-session, Passport-local-mongoose, Passport, and Passport-local for authentication, along with cookies and sessions for user convenience. The data is efficiently managed using Mongoose, making the platform a safe and user-friendly space for food enthusiasts.
